## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to **Synology-Homebrew** ‚Äì the easiest and safest way to get Homebrew running on your Synology NAS or macOS device.

This installer:

- Ensures Homebrew is correctly mounted on DSM 7.2+
- Avoids overwriting or deleting existing Synology packages
- Comes with a full uninstall option
- Mirrors your terminal setup on macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon)

üì¶ Whether you're setting up Neovim, configuring plugins with `config.yaml`, or building a powerful shell with zsh and oh-my-zsh, this repo helps you do it cleanly and consistently.

---

## üí° Why Homebrew on Synology or macOS?

Homebrew, the package manager for macOS and Linux, unlocks a vast ecosystem of open-source tools. On Synology NAS, this means:

- Installing modern CLI tools without waiting for package updates
- Using advanced dev environments on low-power NAS devices
- Sharing dotfiles/config across macOS & NAS seamlessly

---

## üîß Key Features

- **Installation Modes**: Minimal or Advanced setups based on your needs.
- **Synology Integration**: Coexists with Synology packages without removing or breaking system services.
- **Cross-Platform**: Use the same config on Synology NAS, Intel Macs, and Apple Silicon.
- **Safe Uninstall**: Revert your system to its original state using the provided script.
- **Zsh & Theme Setup**: Comes with oh-my-zsh, powerlevel10k, and aliases for a powerful terminal experience.
- **Neovim Ready**: Optional full Neovim configuration via kickstart.nvim or your custom dotfiles.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Trust


This script is designed with safety in mind:

- **No hidden network calls** to unknown sources.
- **Does not capture credentials** or sudo passwords.
- **Respects your Synology environment** ‚Äì does not remove or conflict with built-in packages.
- **Full uninstall script** included for rollback.
- All code is open-source and auditable. [Submit issues](https://github.com/MrCee/Synology-Homebrew/issues) or PRs to improve security.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

### üöÄ Quick Start (Synology NAS)

1. **SSH into your Synology NAS** (DSM 7.2 or newer).
2. **Run the following command** to clone the repo and launch the installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrCee/Synology-Homebrew.git ~/Synology-Homebrew && \
~/Synology-Homebrew/install-synology-homebrew.sh
```

3. **Choose your install type** when prompted:

---

### üßº Option 1: Minimal Install (Clean & Lightweight)

- Installs Homebrew and core dependencies only
- Ignores all additional packages in `config.yaml`
- Use this for a bare setup or as a base to build on later

You can rerun the installer at any time to switch to Advanced mode or uninstall.

---

### ‚ö° Option 2: Advanced Install (Fully Loaded)

- Installs everything defined in `config.yaml`
- Includes Neovim, CLI tools, shell enhancements, aliases, plugins, and themes
- Recommended for a full developer-ready setup

---

### üì¶ Packages Always Installed

Regardless of install type, the following **essential packages** are always included to support Homebrew functionality on Synology:

- `git`, `ruby`, `glibc`, `gcc`, `python3`, `yq`, `zsh`, `oh-my-zsh`


---

## üìã Prerequisites & Preflight

### üßæ Synology NAS Requirements

Make sure the following are configured:

- ‚úÖ Synology NAS with **DSM 7.2 or later**
- ‚úÖ **SSH access** enabled (`Control Panel > Terminal & SNMP > Enable SSH service`)
- ‚úÖ **User home directories** enabled (`Control Panel > User > Advanced > Enable user home service`)
- ‚úÖ Set up **scheduled task** (see below) to remount Homebrew after reboot

---

### üì• Install Git via CLI (if needed)

If Git is not already installed, run this command to install a minimal version. This will later be replaced by Homebrew‚Äôs Git:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrCee/Synology-Git/refs/heads/main/install-synology-git.sh | bash
```

---

### üíª macOS Terminal Environment (Optional but Recommended)

For macOS users planning to sync terminal config with Synology:

- Use **iTerm2** instead of the default Terminal.app
- Install a **Nerd Font** (e.g., [nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads))
- Configure a color profile (e.g. coolnight.itermcolors)

Check the [iTerm2 Configuration Guide](https://github.com/MrCee/Synology-Homebrew/wiki/iTerm2-Configuration) for setup instructions.

---

### üîÅ Persist Homebrew After Reboot (Synology)

To automatically mount the Homebrew directory after a NAS reboot:

1. Go to **Control Panel > Task Scheduler**
2. Click **Create > Triggered Task > User-defined Script**
3. Configure as follows:

#### **1st Tab (General)**

- **Task Name**: `Homebrew Boot`
- **User**: `root`
- **Event**: `Boot-up`
- **Enabled**: ‚úÖ

#### **2nd Tab (Script)**

Paste this into the **User-defined script** box:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure /home exists
[[ ! -d /home ]] && sudo mkdir /home

# Only mount if it's not already a mountpoint
if ! grep -qs ' /home ' /proc/mounts; then
  sudo mount -o bind "$(readlink -f /var/services/homes)" /home
fi

# Permission fixes
sudo chown root:root /home
sudo chmod 775 /home

if [[ -d /home/linuxbrew ]]; then
  sudo chown root:root /home/linuxbrew
  sudo chmod 775 /home/linuxbrew
fi
```
---

## üõ†Ô∏è Configure Packages with `config.yaml`

If you chose **Advanced Install**, your setup is driven by a YAML configuration file.

This file lets you define exactly what packages, plugins, themes, and aliases to install. It‚Äôs fully customizable ‚Äî just edit the actions or add your own!

---

### üìÇ File Location

After cloning this repo, you'll find the config file at:

```bash
~/Synology-Homebrew/config.yaml
```

Open it in your favorite editor:

```bash
nvim ~/Synology-Homebrew/config.yaml
# or
nano ~/Synology-Homebrew/config.yaml
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Available Actions

Each item (package, plugin, etc.) supports three actions:

- `install`: install it
- `uninstall`: remove it (if installed)
- `skip`: ignore it (leave it as-is)

---

### üì¶ Example: Packages Section

```yaml
packages:
  neovim:
    action: install
    aliases:
      vim: "nvim"
    eval: []
  bat:
    action: install
    aliases:
      cat: "bat --paging=never"
    eval: []
  eza:
    action: install
    aliases:
      ls: "eza --color=always --group-directories-first --icons"
      ll: "eza -la --icons --octal-permissions --group-directories-first --icons"
      l: "eza -bGF --header --git --color=always --group-directories-first --icons"
      llm: "eza -lbGd --header --git --sort=modified --color=always --group-directories-first --icons"
      la: "eza --long --all --group --group-directories-first"
      lx: "eza -lbhHigUmuSa@ --time-style=long-iso --git --color-scale --color=always --group-directories-first --icons"
      lS: "eza -1 --color=always --group-directories-first --icons"
      lt: "eza --tree --level=2 --color=always --group-directories-first --icons"
      l.: "eza -a | grep -E '^\\.'"
    eval: []
  zoxide:
    action: install
    aliases:
      cd: "z"
    eval:
      - "zoxide init zsh"
```

---

### üé® Example: Plugins Section

```yaml
plugins:
  powerlevel10k:
    action: install
    url: "https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k"
    directory: "~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel10k"
    aliases: []
    eval: []
  kickstart.nvim:
    action: install
    url: "https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim"
    directory: "~/.config/nvim-kickstart"
    aliases:
      nvim: 'NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-kickstart" nvim'
    eval: []
```

---

### üß† Pro Tips

- Use `aliases` to override default commands (e.g. `ls ‚Üí eza`)
- Use `eval` to inject shell behavior after installing a package
- Skip unused packages instead of deleting them ‚Äî easier to toggle later
- You can comment out any section using `#`

---

### üîÑ Applying Changes

You can re-run the installer any time:

```bash
~/Synology-Homebrew/install-synology-homebrew.sh
```

It will re-read your updated `config.yaml` and apply the new actions.

## ‚ú® Neovim Setup

Neovim (`nvim`) is fully supported and enhanced out of the box ‚Äî ready for power users.

You can choose to run a custom config or use the **kickstart.nvim** template for a smart default.

---

### üìÅ Neovim Config Script

This repo includes a helper script:  
```bash
~/Synology-Homebrew/nvim_config.sh
```

Run it manually to:

- Enable system clipboard over SSH via OSC52
- Install Python support for linting and plugins
- Setup Ruby gem support
- Add helpful scripts like `fzf-git.sh` for Git integration

```bash
bash ~/Synology-Homebrew/nvim_config.sh
```

---

### üöÄ Using Kickstart.nvim (optional template)

Want a clean, fast Neovim config with everything pre-wired?

1. In `config.yaml`, find the `plugins:` section
2. Set `kickstart.nvim` to `action: install`

```yaml
plugins:
  kickstart.nvim:
    action: install
    url: "https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim"
    directory: "~/.config/nvim-kickstart"
    aliases:
      nvim: 'NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-kickstart" nvim'
```

---

### üîÑ Switching Between Configs

In your `~/.zshrc`, add an alias to switch Neovim configs easily:

```zsh
# Kickstart config
alias nvim="NVIM_APPNAME='nvim-kickstart' nvim"

# Your own config
alias nvim="NVIM_APPNAME='nvim-mrcee' nvim"
```

If no alias is set, Neovim defaults to:

```bash
~/.config/nvim
```

---

### ‚úÖ Final Step: Health Check

After installation, launch Neovim:

```bash
nvim
```

Then, inside Neovim, run:

```
:checkhealth
```

This will check your environment and highlight any missing dependencies, misconfigured plugins, or setup issues.

üí° If you've configured aliases via `.zshrc`, be sure you're launching the correct Neovim app profile:

```bash
NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-kickstart" nvim
```

## üñåÔ∏è Customize Your Zsh

Your shell environment comes preloaded with:

- `zsh` + `oh-my-zsh`
- The `powerlevel10k` theme
- Helpful plugins (e.g. autosuggestions, syntax highlighting)
- Useful command aliases (like `ll`, `vim ‚Üí nvim`, `cat ‚Üí bat`, `cd ‚Üí zoxide`, `ls ‚Üí eza`)


Customize further with:

```bash
p10k configure
```

This interactive wizard lets you choose your preferred prompt style, icons, spacing, and color themes.
