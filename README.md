## üöÄ Overview

**Synology-Homebrew** provides a safe, repeatable way to install and manage Homebrew on **Synology DSM 7.2+** and **macOS**, with two modes:

- **Minimal**: a clean base install of Homebrew + essentials  
- **Advanced**: drive everything from a `config.yaml` (packages, plugins, aliases)

It respects your Synology environment, avoids overwriting system packages, and includes a full uninstall path.

---

## üî• What‚Äôs New (Minimal mode fixes)

Thanks to user reports (e.g., large bottles like `binutils` or `gcc` extracting into `/`, and YAML being parsed in Minimal mode), the installer has been updated:

- **Minimal ‚â† YAML**  
  Minimal no longer touches `config.yaml`. YAML parsing now only happens in **Advanced** mode.

- **Bottles extract off the tiny root volume (DSM)**  
  On Synology, Homebrew‚Äôs temp is forced to **`$HOME/tmp`**, preventing large bottles from filling `/tmp` on `md0`.  
  The script also sets `TMPDIR=$HOME/tmp` during install.

- **Safer pruning in Minimal mode**  
  After a Minimal run, the script can **optionally prune** your system back to a minimal set by **only offering to uninstall leaf formulas** (things you explicitly installed).  
  On macOS and Synology, baselines differ (see below).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

### üöÄ Quick Start (Synology NAS)

1. SSH into DSM 7.2+  
2. Clone & run the installer:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/MrCee/Synology-Homebrew.git ~/Synology-Homebrew && \
~/Synology-Homebrew/install-synology-homebrew.sh
```

Choose **1 = Minimal** or **2 = Advanced** when prompted.

---

### üíª Quick Start (macOS)

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/MrCee/Synology-Homebrew.git ~/Synology-Homebrew && \
~/Synology-Homebrew/install-synology-homebrew.sh
```

- On Intel Macs, Homebrew installs to `/usr/local`  
- On Apple Silicon Macs, Homebrew installs to `/opt/homebrew`  
- The installer adds `brew shellenv` to your `~/.zprofile` so Homebrew is always on your PATH  

---

## üßº Option 1: Minimal Install (Clean & Lightweight)

- Installs **Homebrew + essentials** only (platform-specific baseline)  
- **Ignores `config.yaml` entirely**  
- Offers a **prune** prompt at the end (optional) to remove extras you installed previously  

### Minimal baselines

- **Synology/Linux baseline**  
  `binutils glibc gcc git ruby python3 zsh yq`

- **macOS baseline**  
  `git yq ruby python3 coreutils findutils gnu-sed grep gawk`  

> On DSM, bottle extraction is done under `$HOME/tmp` to avoid filling the small `/` volume.

---

## ‚ö° Option 2: Advanced Install (Fully Loaded)

- Parses **`config.yaml`** and applies your declared actions:  
  - `install` ‚Üí install package/plugin  
  - `uninstall` ‚Üí remove it  
  - `skip` ‚Üí do nothing  
- Adds aliases and `eval` lines to your `~/.zshrc`, but only for packages you‚Äôve chosen to keep  
- Invokes optional Neovim bootstrap and Zsh configuration helpers when flagged in YAML  

**File location:**
```zsh
~/Synology-Homebrew/config.yaml
```

**Open it with:**
```zsh
nvim ~/Synology-Homebrew/config.yaml
# or
nano ~/Synology-Homebrew/config.yaml
```

**Example (excerpt):**
```yaml
packages:
  neovim:
    action: install
    aliases:
      vim: "nvim"
    eval: []

  bat:
    action: install
    aliases:
      cat: "bat --paging=never"
    eval: []

plugins:
  powerlevel10k:
    action: install
    url: "https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k"
    directory: "~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel10k"
    aliases: []
    eval: []

  kickstart.nvim:
    action: install
    url: "https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim"
    directory: "~/.config/nvim-kickstart"
    aliases:
      nvim: 'NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-kickstart" nvim'
    eval: []
```

---

## üçÉ Minimal ‚ÄúPrune‚Äù (What it does and doesn‚Äôt do)

At the end of **Minimal mode**:

- The script computes **extras** by comparing your **explicitly installed leaf formulas** (`brew leaves`) with the **minimal baseline** for your platform.  
- It **offers** to uninstall those extras.  
- It **does not** remove dependencies required by remaining formulas or by Homebrew itself.  

This keeps pruning **safe** and predictable.

---

## üß± Synology Notes (DSM 7.2+)

- **Homebrew temp** is set to **`$HOME/tmp`** during install so big bottles don‚Äôt fill `/`:  
  - `HOMEBREW_TEMP=$HOME/tmp`  
  - `TMPDIR=$HOMEBREW_TEMP`  
- After installation, `~/.profile` is updated to include Homebrew‚Äôs bin directories.  
- A post-boot Task Scheduler job can re-bind `/home` and fix permissions (see snippet below).

**Suggested boot task (User-defined Script):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
[[ ! -d /home ]] && sudo mkdir /home
if ! grep -qs ' /home ' /proc/mounts; then
  sudo mount -o bind "$(readlink -f /var/services/homes)" /home
fi
sudo chown root:root /home && sudo chmod 775 /home
if [[ -d /home/linuxbrew ]]; then
  sudo chown root:root /home/linuxbrew && sudo chmod 775 /home/linuxbrew
fi
```

---

## üçé macOS Notes

- Homebrew installs to `/opt/homebrew` on Apple Silicon, and `/usr/local` on Intel  
- The installer updates your `~/.zprofile` with `brew shellenv`  
- Since macOS already includes zsh, the script does not install it  
- **oh-my-zsh** is installed by default (you can comment that block out if you don‚Äôt want it)  

---

## üß™ Neovim (optional)

You can bootstrap Neovim via **Advanced** mode and/or use `kickstart.nvim`.  
Switch profiles with `NVIM_APPNAME`:

```zsh
NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-kickstart" nvim
```

Inside Neovim, run:
```vim
:checkhealth
```

## üñåÔ∏è Customize Your Zsh

Your shell environment comes preloaded with:

- `zsh` + `oh-my-zsh`  
- The `powerlevel10k` theme  
- Helpful plugins (such as autosuggestions and syntax highlighting)  
- Useful command aliases (`ll`, `vim ‚Üí nvim`, `cat ‚Üí bat`, `cd ‚Üí zoxide`, `ls ‚Üí eza`)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Safety

- No hidden network calls beyond Homebrew itself  
- No credentials or sudo passwords are logged  
- Sudoers fragments are created + removed automatically at the end of a run  
- Full uninstall path is included  
- 100% open-source and auditable  

---

## üß© Troubleshooting

### ‚ÄúNo space left on device‚Äù unpacking bottles (DSM)  
This happens because DSM‚Äôs `/tmp` lives on the small `md0` volume. The installer now sets:

```zsh
export HOMEBREW_TEMP=$HOME/tmp
export TMPDIR=$HOMEBREW_TEMP
```

### Minimal tried to validate YAML  
Fixed. Minimal no longer touches `config.yaml`. YAML parsing only happens in **Advanced**.

### Minimal ‚Äúprune‚Äù isn‚Äôt removing enough  
Prune only targets **leaf formulas** (`brew leaves`). To remove dependencies, uninstall their leaf dependents first.

### Git messages during install  
The installer shows the current git commit hash and whether your branch is up to date with `origin`. This is informational only.

## üì• Install Git (DSM) if missing

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrCee/Synology-Git/refs/heads/main/install-synology-git.sh | bash
```
