### 🚀 Overview

**Synology-Homebrew** provides a safe, repeatable way to install and manage Homebrew on **Synology DSM** and **macOS**, with two modes:

- **Minimal**: a clean base install of Homebrew + essentials  
- **Advanced**: drive everything from a `config.yaml` (packages, plugins, aliases)

It respects your Synology environment, avoids overwriting system packages, and includes a full uninstall path.

*macOS support exists to allow the same `config.yaml` used on a Synology NAS to be applied consistently on a Mac (for development, replication, or local tooling parity).*

## 🔥 What’s New Jan 2026

**Expanded DSM compatibility with explicit platform safeguards**  

DSM 7.1 is supported on a best-effort basis.  
32-bit platforms are not supported by Homebrew and are blocked by the installer.

Because DSM 7.1 can run on unsupported 32-bit platforms, the installer performs upfront CPU architecture validation to prevent silent Homebrew installer failures.

---

## ⚙️ Installation Guide

### 🚀 Quick Start (Synology NAS)

1. SSH into DSM 7.2+  
2. Clone & run the installer:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/MrCee/Synology-Homebrew.git ~/Synology-Homebrew && \
~/Synology-Homebrew/install-synology-homebrew.sh
```

Choose **1 = Minimal** or **2 = Advanced** when prompted.

---

### 💻 Quick Start (macOS)

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/MrCee/Synology-Homebrew.git ~/Synology-Homebrew && \
~/Synology-Homebrew/install-synology-homebrew.sh
```

- On Intel Macs, Homebrew installs to `/usr/local`  
- On Apple Silicon Macs, Homebrew installs to `/opt/homebrew`  
- The installer adds `brew shellenv` to your `~/.zprofile` so Homebrew is always on your PATH  

---

## 🧼 Option 1: Minimal Install (Clean & Lightweight)

- Installs **Homebrew + essentials** only (platform-specific baseline)  
- Offers a **prune** prompt at the end (optional) to remove extras you installed previously  

### Minimal baselines

- **Synology/Linux baseline**  
  `binutils glibc gcc git ruby python3 zsh yq`

- **macOS baseline**  
  `git yq ruby python3 coreutils findutils gnu-sed grep gawk`  

---

## ⚡ Option 2: Advanced Install (Fully Loaded)

- Parses **`config.yaml`** and applies your declared actions:  
  - `install` → install package/plugin  
  - `uninstall` → remove it  
  - `skip` → do nothing  
- Adds aliases and `eval` lines to your `~/.zshrc`, but only for packages you’ve chosen to keep  
- Invokes optional Neovim bootstrap and Zsh configuration helpers when flagged in YAML  

**File location:**
```zsh
~/Synology-Homebrew/config.yaml
```

**Edit with your preferred editor:**

```zsh
nvim ~/Synology-Homebrew/config.yaml
# or
nano ~/Synology-Homebrew/config.yaml
```

**Example (excerpt):**
```yaml
packages:
  neovim:
    action: install
    aliases:
      vim: "nvim"
    eval: []

  bat:
    action: install
    aliases:
      cat: "bat --paging=never"
    eval: []

plugins:
  powerlevel10k:
    action: install
    url: "https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k"
    directory: "~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel10k"
    aliases: []
    eval: []

  kickstart.nvim:
    action: install
    url: "https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim"
    directory: "~/.config/nvim-kickstart"
    aliases:
      nvim: 'NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-kickstart" nvim'
    eval: []
```

## 🍃 Minimal “Prune” (What it does and doesn’t do)

At the end of **Minimal mode**:

- The script computes **extras** by comparing your **explicitly installed leaf formulas** (`brew leaves`) with the **minimal baseline** for your platform.  
- It **offers** to uninstall those extras.  
- It **does not** remove dependencies required by remaining formulas or by Homebrew itself.  

This keeps pruning **safe** and predictable.

---

## 🧱 Synology Notes

- `/home` is bind-mounted from `/var/services/homes`
- Permissions are repaired defensively
- Homebrew is isolated from Synology system packages
- No permanent DSM modifications are required

**Suggested boot task (User-defined Script):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
[[ ! -d /home ]] && sudo mkdir /home
if ! grep -qs ' /home ' /proc/mounts; then
  sudo mount -o bind "$(readlink -f /var/services/homes)" /home
fi
sudo chown root:root /home && sudo chmod 775 /home
if [[ -d /home/linuxbrew ]]; then
  sudo chown root:root /home/linuxbrew && sudo chmod 775 /home/linuxbrew
fi
```

---

## 🍎 macOS Notes

- Homebrew installs to `/opt/homebrew` on Apple Silicon, and `/usr/local` on Intel  
- The installer updates your `~/.zprofile` with `brew shellenv`  
- Since macOS already includes zsh, the script does not install it  

---

## 🧪 Neovim (optional)

You can bootstrap Neovim via **Advanced** mode and/or use `kickstart.nvim`.  
Switch profiles with `NVIM_APPNAME`:

```zsh
NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-kickstart" nvim
```

Inside Neovim, run:
```vim
:checkhealth
```

## 🖌️ Customize Your Zsh

Your shell environment comes preloaded with:

- `zsh` + `oh-my-zsh`  
- The `powerlevel10k` theme  
- Helpful plugins (such as autosuggestions and syntax highlighting)  
- Useful command aliases (`ll`, `vim → nvim`, `cat → bat`, `cd → zoxide`, `ls → eza`)
